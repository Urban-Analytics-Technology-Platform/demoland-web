## Static files

- `values/*.json`, `changes/*.json`

  - These represent respectively *values* which are plotted on the map (including land use signatures and the output indicators), and *changes* of input macro variables relative to the baseline.

  - Generate these by running the `generate.py` script. Set the `$DEMOLAND_DATA` environment variable to point to the shared OneDrive DemoLand folder before running it.

- `newcastle.json`

  - Contains geographic boundaries for Output Areas used in the 2011 census.
  - Actually a GeoJSON file, but TypeScript complains if you try to import JSON from a file with an extension that isn't `.json`.
  - Obtained from the [Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::output-areas-dec-2011-boundaries-ew-bgc/about), but cut down to only include the OAs in Tyne and Wear, which is the relevant region for this project.
  - Numeric IDs have also been added for each feature. Ideally, we'd like to work with string IDs which correspond to the names of the OAs, but [MapLibre doesn't work with string IDs (unless they can be coerced to numbers)](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/issues/1043).
  - Can be regenerated by running the following script:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import geopandas as gpd
    baseline = pd.read_json('baseline.json', orient='index')
    oas = baseline.index.values
    gj = gpd.read_file('Output_Areas_Dec_2011_Boundaries_EW_BGC_2022_3211360474256931029.geojson')
    gj = gj.query('OA11CD in @oas')[['OA11CD', 'geometry']]
    gj['id'] = range(len(gj))
    gj.to_crs(epsg=4326).to_file('newcastle.json', driver='GeoJSON')
    ```
