## Static files

- `baseline_prediction.json`, `scenario{i}.json` (i = 1 to 7)

  - These are generated from the corresponding csv files stored in OneDrive with a simple script:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    for fname in ['baseline_prediction', *[f'scenario{i}' for i in range(1, 8)]]:
        df = pd.read_csv(f'{fname}.csv')
        df = df.set_index('geo_code')
        df.to_json(path_or_buf=f'{fname}.json', orient='index')
    ```

- `newcastle.json`

  - Contains geographic boundaries for Output Areas used in the 2011 census.
  - Actually a GeoJSON file, but TypeScript complains if you try to import JSON from a file with an extension that isn't `.json`.
  - Obtained from the [Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::output-areas-dec-2011-boundaries-ew-bgc/about), but cut down to only include the OAs in Tyne and Wear, which is the relevant region for this project.
  - Can be regenerated by running the following script:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import geopandas as gpd
    baseline = pd.read_csv('baseline_prediction.csv')
    oas = baseline['geo_code'].values
    gj = gpd.read_file('oa_2011_bgc.geojson')  # replace with the name of the downloaded file
    gj = gj.query('OA11CD in @oas')[['OA11CD', 'geometry']]
    gj.to_crs(epsg=4326).to_file('newcastle.json', driver='GeoJSON')
    ```
