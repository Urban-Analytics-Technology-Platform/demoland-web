        “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
        repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
        you.”

        Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
        doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,
        and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately
        followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
        heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
        tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a
        degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
        to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
        consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
        suit.
